Feature: Conway's Game of Life's Rules

  Rules of Conway's Game of Life
  > The universe of the _Game of Life_ is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells.
  > Each cell is in one of two possible states:
  > * Alive aka populated
  > * Dead aka unpopulated
  >
  > Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors.
  > The neighbors are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
  > At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
  > 1. Underpopulation: Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
  > 1. Survival: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives on to the next generation.
  > 1. Overpopulation Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.
  > 1. Reproduction (birth): Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.
